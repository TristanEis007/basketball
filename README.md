# basketball

Hi, I am a graduate student at Columbia University's engineering school where I study topics related to Machine Learning, Optimization, Data Mining and Data Science in general.  

Before coming to the US, I played basketball in Europe (Spain, France, Switzerland). Needless to say, my appreciation of the game never really stoped. 

Since I still spend countless hours reading the box scores of NBA games, I decided to create this repository to share cool basketball stats and insights. I'll put to work what I am studying at Columbia to produce some cool data visualization tools. I'll also apply Machine Learning algorithms to learn more from the data. I'll try to update this repository regularly.
